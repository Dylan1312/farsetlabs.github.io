Farset Labs is a mix of people with a mix of ambitions. Some want a high flying career, some want a steady existance, and some want to jump off a cliff and build a plane on the way down.

If you're one of the latter ones, you might be interested in the <a title="ITI Seedcorn" href="http://www.intertradeireland.com/seedcorn/">ITI SeedCorn </a>competition. Long story short, it's a business plan competition for up and coming SME's, entrepreneurs or just people with an idea, competing for a share of €280,000 in funding, as<a href="http://farsetlabs.org.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/showreel_template.gif">
</a> well as a wealth of mentorship support and advice.

If you want more information, or just want to get a feel for the competition, they're having a free <a title="Briefing Day" href="http://www.intertradeireland.com/seedcorn/events/name,11057,en.html">briefing day</a> on Wed 6th. (NOTE The venue has changed from the Holiday Inn to the <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/c6u7">Momentum offices on Ravenhill Road</a>)

Best of luck, and don't forget your old friends Farset when you make it big!

Farset Labs in association with the <a href="http://www.dcalni.gov.uk/" target="_blank">Department of Culture, Arts, and Leisure's</a> "Culture Month" are inviting makers, breakers, designers, fashionistas, hackers, painters, sculptors, teachers, and any other kind of practical creative to just 'hang out', and encourage serendipity.

Stuck in a creative rut? <em>There's nothing better than bouncing your ideas off someone else from a completely different field.</em>

Looking for a new project? <em>The best ideas come at the interfaces between fields.</em>

Just want a drink? <em>They've got them too. </em>

Also, if any organisations wish to support this cause by throwing some money behind the bar, give us a shout on events@farsetlabs.org.uk and we'll give you plenty of PR consideration!
<h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>I don't think I'm the right kinda person to go to this...</strong></h3>
That's not actually a question, but if you've made it this far, you probably are!
<h3><strong>But I won't know anyone! Is this another one of those horrible networking events?</strong></h3>
No, no agenda, just talk to people, say "Hello, I'm X, what do you make?" and -BOOM-... new friend city.
<h3><strong>Can I bring stuff to show off?</strong></h3>
Yes, but it better be awesome cus noone likes a showoff... unless they've got blinking lights and shiny! But seriously, it's a bar, be sensible about what you're bringing...
<h3><strong>Are there ID requirements or an age limit to enter the event?</strong></h3>
It's a Bar, so 18+ only please

Flacknite was a great success, despite being stood up by Red Bull and some questionable sleeping patterns!

All in all, we got a lot done, and have learned a lot about how people work independently in these kind of events;

In terms of 'stuff done', probably the best show piece was <a title="Ryan Grieve" href="http://thegrieve.co.uk/blog/" target="_blank">Ryan Grieve</a>'s <a title="MicroID" href="http://ryangrieve.com/games/microid/" target="_blank">Microid game</a> that he wrote for  <strong><a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/minild/" target="_blank">Mini LD</a></strong> games jam - 19th-20th May 2012, where he restricted himself to 64x18 pixels, causing hours and hours of lost/distracted time for everyone else! Thanks Ryan!

Additionally, we got alot of work done in terms of our <a href="http://unit1.farsetlabs.org.uk/redmine/projects/farset-rfid-acc" target="_blank">RFID access system</a>, even though our planned external reader turned out to be a 'useless' standard that no-one has... But our striker is working and we're waiting on a new reader to open the space up to all. CCTV is up, but not ready yet, <a href="http://unit1.farsetlabs.org.uk/redmine/projects/farset-cctv/activity" target="_blank">pending the arrival of our capture card</a>. Network is done to <a href="http://twitter.com/stealthii" target="_blank">Stealthii's </a>satisfaction.

Andrew Luke got a lot of work done on his great <a title="Absence Comic" href="http://absencecomic.com/" target="_blank">website</a> for his comic about coping with Epilepsy, a project part funded by <a title="UnLtd" href="http://www.unltd.org.uk/" target="_blank">UnLtd</a>.

<a href="http://twitter.com/stevebiscuit" target="_blank">Steve Wilkin</a> got a <a href="http://sickbiscuit.com/blog/2012/05/20/an-ios-client-for-my-coffee-tracker-api/" target="_blank">iOS client for his CoffeeTracker</a> project built.

<a href="http://twitter.com/robelkin">Rob Elkin</a> and co were working on a Native iOS management app for <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/" target="_blank">MongoDB </a>instances.

We all ate lots of <a title="Cupcakes" href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7N5S41ZnlKU/T7pveUCvZBI/AAAAAAAAA34/eDb6jMsu-QM/s912/IMG_20120519_134710.jpg" target="_blank">cupcakes</a>, and <a href="http://dominos.co.uk" target="_blank">Dominos</a> pizza, drank <a href="http://www.craftydevil.co.uk/" target="_blank">Crafty Devil</a> supplied Beer, and devoured <a href="http://planzai.com/" target="_blank">Planzai</a> supplied <a href="http://www.boojummex.com/" target="_blank">Boojum</a>.

And of course, Noah built <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/d3z/status/203881118984978435/photo/1" target="_blank">trucks</a>. Long may he build <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/d3z/status/203893358639325184/photo/1" target="_blank">trucks</a>! He's inspired us to 'acquiring' a box-o-lego...

Thanks to everyone for making it as awesome as it was. See you next time!

<a href="http://farsetlabs.org.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/ForSale-disp.gif"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1058" alt="ForSale-disp" src="http://farsetlabs.org.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/ForSale-disp.gif" width="288" height="261" /></a>We had our Town Hall meeting over the weekend, which was a great success that we'll be posting about separately, but one of the suggestions from our fantastic community was to bring back the old-school idea of tech-swaps, or 'Bring and Buy Sales'. Bringing back the classic swap-shop atmosphere with a bang, and also hopefully raise some funds for much-needed upgrades to the space.

The Farset Labs Bring-And-Buy sale enables community members and others to sell or swap their creations, or their attic-junk.

The rules are simple, £5/table for members, £10/table for non-members, and don't try to sell anything illegal.

If you want to attend and check out the wares on offer, don't worry about tickets, just show up! (Although, non-members attending are ecouraged to donate on arrival...)

Get building and get selling!

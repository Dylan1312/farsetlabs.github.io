<a href="http://farsetlabs.org.uk/blog/gathering-of-sleet/25d_sleet/" rel="attachment wp-att-934"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-934" alt="25d_sleet" src="http://farsetlabs.org.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/25d_sleet.png" width="256" height="256" /></a>After a wonderfully democratic <a title="Doodle" href="http://doodle.com/rh4uhdhp2q4gk96c" target="_blank">Doodle</a>, distributed through our Twitter, Facebook, and IRC channels, the community has decided to have another, informal, 'Gathering of Sleet' (aka Gathering of Lightning Event) squeezed into the year at very short notice.

This Sunday! (Thanks for that guys... :P)

Anyway, standard Gathering of Lightning rules apply:
<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Flying pigs after 7 minutes</span></li>
	<li>No Presentation tools (Prezi, Powerpoint, Keynote, Beamer, etc)</li>
	<li>Arbitrary order or presenters</li>
	<li>HecklingÂ Encouraged</li>
</ul>
(Unconfirmed) Presentations offered by the community over the thought process of this so far are:
<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Chrome OS: Are you ready to live in the cloud?</span></li>
	<li>Ruby/Javascript/Io/Twillo/Erlang/Go/Linguistics (One person offered these... brave lad)</li>
	<li>Parallelism in Web Programming</li>
	<li>Windows 8/Windows Mobile App Certification processes / pains</li>
	<li>Dr Strangethings, or How I learned to stop worrying and love Rapid Prototyping</li>
	<li>Probably more!</li>
</ul>
Since it's short notice, we've got no sponsor for this one, but we'll grab a few crates to drink and people are, as always, free to BYO Food/Drink.

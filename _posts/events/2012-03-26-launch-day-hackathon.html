Friday 6th April, 1500 - Saturday 7th April 1500

This is our 'soft launch' event running with no equipment, no budget, very little furniture, no PR and a case of beer.

Entry will be <strong>Â£5, or Free for members</strong> (Sign-up will be available on-site, hint hint), and we'll try and get some munchies/a few drinks in for everyone.

Repeat: <em>We will have very few toys other than what can be donated</em>, but we finally have a space with power and a network.

We can hack the building together (or apart, within reason) and start bringing the dream alive.<!--more-->

December got off to an energetic start with two concurrent events on the first weekend. It was all about project demos at the last <a href="http://farsetlabs.org.uk/blog/gathering-of-sleighbells-christmas-edition/">Gathering of Lightning</a> event of the year, followed by the <a href="http://farsetlabs.org.uk/blog/hack-for-your-community-with-liberty-it/">Hack for Your Community</a> hackathon sponsored by Liberty IT.

We love hackathons. We love what they stand for and what they can achieve, and the fact that you have to be a little insane to undertake them. It's a big ask, to take a day or two out of your social life to enslave yourself to a high-speed, sleepless slog at a project that might not even work at the end of the session. It's been hard to get commitment from a good number of hackers for such events, as many other hackathon organisers have found. The turn-out this time was disappointing, especially against an encouraging number of registrations, so we're contemplating what improvements are needed. Any thoughts would be most welcome.

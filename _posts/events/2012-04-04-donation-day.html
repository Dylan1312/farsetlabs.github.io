Thank you very much to everyone who has offered to donate equipment to Farset Labs - we're very grateful, as members' generosity is what has allowed us to start.

However, none of it is in the space yet, so we'd like to let you know that today (Wednesday 4th April), Farset Labs will be open for the dropping off of equipment from 11am to 6pm.

If you need something bulky picked up, we can send out reinforcements equipped with a trailer and if these times don't suit you, don't hesitate to get in contact (david@farsetlabs.org.uk or eoghan@farsetlabs.org.uk) to arrange a more convenient slot.

We advise that you give us a heads up before you come round to Farset Labs, as we may be away for short periods doing pick-ups of bulky items, but we'll do our best to have someone around to let people in.

If you would like to add your equipment to the list of donations, we'd be very grateful. To do so, fill out our short donation form at <a title="Donate to Farset" href="http://bit.ly/donatetofarset" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/donatetofarset</a>

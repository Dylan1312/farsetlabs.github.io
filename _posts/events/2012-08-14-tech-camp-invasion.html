Tech Camp were introduced to us several months ago by our good friend, <a title="The Man, The Legend" href="https://twitter.com/robelkin">Rob Elkin</a> (who's currently sunning himself on the west coast, lucky duck).

The Nerf Gun battles were Epic in their destruction, The Buzz around our Raspberry Pi's was intense for kids who had never heard of linux before in some cases. The Fascination with our Robotic Arm (which ended up with a laser pen mounted on it

Don't be a stranger guys! And watch this space! We've got a few U18 events in the pipeline (if we can keep the Insurers on side!)

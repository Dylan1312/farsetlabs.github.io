As part of Creativity Month, we have invited the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/makenoisemakemusic">_maker</a> collective up from Dublin to walk attendees through how to build a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_shXac8Vm0" target="_blank">fuzz distortion pedal </a>from start to finish on Saturday the 30th of March. The workshops are aimed at beginners to D.I.Y. electronics and we cover all the essential skills that you will allow you to create your own electronic instruments and effects for you to take home and love!

These classes are normally priced at £60 for normal tickets and £50 for concessions (seniors, students), however, thanks to support from the <a href="http://www.dcalni.gov.uk/" target="_blank">Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure</a> under their <a href="http://creativityni.org/events/category/creativity-month" target="_blank">Creativity Month</a> programme, we're able to subsidise this down to £45 / £35 per person, the concession price includes Farset Labs members, and refreshments will be provided at the event.

Guitarists are encouraged to bring their instruments and a small amp if they have them to play / test with.

Please sign up early as we need to confirm numbers by Saturday the 23rd!

You will be invoiced after signing up via email and payment must be made in advance or you may lose your booking

<strong>UPDATE: Due to slow uptake we're extending the booking deadline. The course WILL be going ahead regardless of additional attendance, and late attendance is not guaranteed.</strong>

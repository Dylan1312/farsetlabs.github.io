Gathering of Lightning, Farset Labs' highly successful ad-hoc presentation series, is coming back!

7th March 1730-2000

This time around we're working in collaboration with the <a href="http://www.bcs.org/category/10444">QUB Science Shop</a> to bring in some weird and wonderful presenters (on top of the usual bunch of miscreants).

<del>We're still working on confirming an event sponsor so it may end up as a 'please donate' event, but we'll keep you posted!</del>

<a href="http://www.bcs.org/category/10444">BCS - Belfast Chapter</a> have confirmed that they will once again be providing refreshments for GoL, so be sure to register on their page too!

<strong>Monday March 25th @ 1900 in the Event Space</strong>

It's that time again, where democracy (otherwise known as "He who shows up, wins") reigns supreme.

We'll be doing the usual financial reporting, strategic reporting, etc, but this time round, we really want to encourage the membership to raise any issues they're having with the space, the community, or the organisation in general.

For mundane things that you're not worried about people talking about, simply add them to the "Members items to be raised" section on the relevant <a href="http://unit1.farsetlabs.org.uk/wiki/index.php/Town_Hall/1303">wiki page</a>Â (or discuss existing items on that pages <a href="http://unit1.farsetlabs.org.uk/wiki/index.php?title=Talk:Town_Hall/1303&amp;action=edit" target="_blank">Talk page</a>)

Alternatively, if there's something private you'd like to discuss with the directors, either contact them generally on admin@farsetlabs.org.uk, or individually on bolster@farsetlabs.org.uk, eoghan@farsetlabs.org.uk or david@farsetlabs.org.uk.

Finally, if there is anything you'd like to raise anonymously, we've set up the below form to submit your issues.

Farset Labs is what you make of it and we aren't psychic; we can't do it without you're support, guidance, and ideas.

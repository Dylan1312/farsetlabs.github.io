Our next Town Hall meeting is scheduled for Monday 2nd December at 7pm in the Event Space* at Farset.

We'll be discussing a variety of issues, as well as giving an update on the work occurring in the space. If you have any questions or concerns, email us at <a href="mailto:admin@farsetlabs.org.uk">admin@farsetlabs.org.uk</a> and we'll add them to the agenda to be brought up. Afterwards, the minutes will be made available here. <strong>EDIT: Link </strong><strong>to minutes is <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vbi01jUhAe3tvdYkXD6iA1x8v6XruKcoFq_WpUyvQOU/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</strong>

*We'll move to the Lounge/Co-working Space if the renovations are affecting the Event Space.

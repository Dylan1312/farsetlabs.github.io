The Farset Labs Bring-And-Buy sale enables community members and others to sell or swap their creations, or their attic-junk.

The rules are simple, £5/table for members, £10/table for non-members, and don&#8217;t try to sell anything illegal.

If you want to attend and check out the wares on offer, don&#8217;t worry about tickets, just show up! (Although, non-members attending are ecouraged to donate on arrival&#8230;)

Get building and get selling!

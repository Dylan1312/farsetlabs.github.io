Over the years, several attempts have been made at making a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace" target="_blank">Hackerspace/Makerspace </a> in Belfast, the aims of which were slightly different but centred around creating a shared experimental facility for the NI tech community. Some people have called it a 'Geek Gym', or a 'Tech Playground', others have called it 'An Amateur Version of the <a href="http://www.qub.ac.uk/sites/nitc/" target="_blank">NITC</a>' but finally, Farset Labs is near realising that goal. Whichever goal that is.

A strong community of technical students and professionals has worked on this for many months (in some <a href="http://www.andrewbolster.info/blog/2010/07/belfast_hackerspac/" target="_blank">cases</a> years), and we're getting near the finish line.

We are going to build a space where people of all technical interests and experiences can come together to work on <a href="http://hackaday.com/" target="_blank">crazy individual or group projects</a>. A space where people who may not be exposed to the latest and greatest bleeding edge computing technologies, can experiment with them in a <a href="http://xen.org/products/cloudxen.html" target="_blank">near-enterprise server environment</a> without having to piss off the boss. A space where where those ideas that would otherwise need lots of <a title="What do we want? STUFF! When do we want it? SOON!" href="http://farsetlabs.org.uk/blog/2012/01/what-do-we-want-stuff-when-do-we-want-it-soon/">additional equipment</a>, can be rapidly built and tested, in a relaxed environment. A space where people can <a href="http://farsetlabs.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Hammock/88503-17839" target="_blank">chill out</a> between projects and <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/248725/lego_minecraft_set_is_one_step_closer_to_reality_geeks_rejoice.html" target="_blank">play with Legos</a>.

It's taken time to get this far, and it's going to take a lot of time and community support to make this successful.

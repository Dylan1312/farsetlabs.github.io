Flacknite was a great success, despite being stood up by Red Bull and some questionable sleeping patterns!

All in all, we got a lot done, and have learned a lot about how people work independently in these kind of events;

In terms of &#8216;stuff done&#8217;, probably the best show piece was [Ryan Grieve](http://thegrieve.co.uk/blog/)&#8216;s [Microid game](http://ryangrieve.com/games/microid/) that he wrote for  **[Mini LD](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/minild/)** games jam &#8211; 19th-20th May 2012, where he restricted himself to 64&#215;18 pixels, causing hours and hours of lost/distracted time for everyone else! Thanks Ryan!

Additionally, we got alot of work done in terms of our [RFID access system](http://unit1.farsetlabs.org.uk/redmine/projects/farset-rfid-acc), even though our planned external reader turned out to be a &#8216;useless&#8217; standard that no-one has&#8230; But our striker is working and we&#8217;re waiting on a new reader to open the space up to all. CCTV is up, but not ready yet, [pending the arrival of our capture card](http://unit1.farsetlabs.org.uk/redmine/projects/farset-cctv/activity). Network is done to [Stealthii&#8217;s ](http://twitter.com/stealthii)satisfaction.

Andrew Luke got a lot of work done on his great [website](http://absencecomic.com/) for his comic about coping with Epilepsy, a project part funded by [UnLtd](http://www.unltd.org.uk/).

[Steve Wilkin](http://twitter.com/stevebiscuit) got a [iOS client for his CoffeeTracker](http://sickbiscuit.com/blog/2012/05/20/an-ios-client-for-my-coffee-tracker-api/) project built.

[Rob Elkin][1] and co were working on a Native iOS management app for [MongoDB ](http://www.mongodb.org/)instances.

We all ate lots of [cupcakes](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7N5S41ZnlKU/T7pveUCvZBI/AAAAAAAAA34/eDb6jMsu-QM/s912/IMG_20120519_134710.jpg), and [Dominos](http://dominos.co.uk) pizza, drank [Crafty Devil](http://www.craftydevil.co.uk/) supplied Beer, and devoured [Planzai](http://planzai.com/) supplied [Boojum](http://www.boojummex.com/).

And of course, Noah built [trucks](https://twitter.com/#!/d3z/status/203881118984978435/photo/1). Long may he build [trucks](https://twitter.com/#!/d3z/status/203893358639325184/photo/1)! He&#8217;s inspired us to &#8216;acquiring&#8217; a box-o-lego&#8230;

Thanks to everyone for making it as awesome as it was. See you next time!

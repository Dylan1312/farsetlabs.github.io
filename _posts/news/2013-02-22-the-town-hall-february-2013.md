The entire Farset Labs membership were invited to the Town Hall meeting on Saturday the 16th of February, 2013, and a total of 7 active members turned up, with some additional people turning up out of interest. Among the matters of business was one vote and a discussion on all other issues, as detailed below.

### Code of Conduct Review

As mandated in the Code of Conduct, the document is to be reviewed at least once a year, but may be changed at any time given the approval of the membership. The review for 2013 was held at the February Town Hall meeting, and it passed with a vote of 7 ayes, 0 noes and 0 abstentions. The changes outlined were mostly wording changes, but some new clauses covering the use of specialised equipment, the use of VPS, VPN and Web services provided by Evorack and Tibus, and a clause governing member representation of Farset Labs (to protect the members from any legal liability).

These changes will be made available soon and the online versions of the Code will be updated appropriately. If you have any issues or wish to change or add anything in the Code, please bring it up at the next Town Hall meeting, or get in touch as outlined below.

### Other Matters of Business

In other news, investigations are ongoing to price reversible (fleece/waterproof jacket) coats branded with the Labs&#8217; logo and member names/handles, plus some other apparel options. A &#8220;common sense&#8221; ideology for use of the 3D printer and other specialised, easy-to-wreck equipment was stressed, and a tally of the workshop tools to date, both installed and incoming, was taken.

The store&#8217;s indexing system to make things easily to find and return is complete, with the allocations changing as the best practice becomes apparent. In the next while, truly useless items will be disposed of. They will be left for a period of 1 week and will be advertised on our social media outlets if you are interested in taking them yourself.

After our first birthday (more on that soon), two new Director positions will be open to voting for the membership body, with any member not disqualified from holding a directorship to a UK Limited Company being eligible. After the first elections, there will be subsequent elections every year for all five positions.

The state of the Labs&#8217; finances was reviewed, with an overall positive result. However, as our utilities and equipment use grows, we will need more income, and **could do with some more members**.

The series of events scheduled for the upcoming month was laid out, with comments made on future Gathering of Lightening talks regarding presenting. Our GoL talks are open to members and the general public; admission is ticket-based because it is usually a very popular event.

Open discussion to the floor quickly turned jokey, but one non-member who attended commented that we should consider buying lots of canned air.

### Â The next meeting

The next Town Hall meeting will be scheduled for March 2013 and will be published widely with good notice. Comments, complaints and questions can be sent via email ([anonymously](http://www.sendanonymousemail.net/) or not), but voting matters are open to members only who attend the meeting.

See you then!

Farset Labs is playing host to the [Weavers Court CoderDojo][1], kicking things off with a &#8216;soft launch&#8217; next Thursday the 21st from 17:30-20:00. With mentors (and kids) hopefully coming from all over the park and from the community of Sandy Row, we think that this will be a great addition to our [growing outreach activities][2].

We&#8217;ll be running the Dojo on the First and Third Thursday&#8217;s of the month (we know this makes for a strange end-of-May, but it&#8217;s the lesser of two evils&#8230;)

[CoderDojo][3] is a movement orientated around running free not-for-profit coding clubs and regular sessions for young people.

At a CoderDojo, young people learn how to code, develop websites, apps, programs, games and more. Dojos are set up, run by and taught at by volunteers. In addition to learning to code, members meet like minded people, show off what they’ve been working on and so on. CoderDojo makes development and learning to code a fun, sociable, kick ass experience.

CoderDojo also puts a strong emphasis on open source and free software, and has a strong network of members and volunteers globally. CoderDojo has just one rule: “Above All: Be Cool“, bullying, lying, wasting people’s time and so on is uncool.

It also provides essential teaching and mentorship experience for budding software developers; after all, to teach is to learn twice! And you don&#8217;t have to be a hardcore code-hacker to mentor; anyone can help to guide these kids through the processes of problem solving, breaking down tasks, thinking in a stepwise fashion, or just picking out the killer-spelling-mistakes like variable names or missing semi-colons!

**FAQs**

**Is there an age limit to enter the event?**

[CoderDojo][3] is aimed loosely at the under 18&#8242;s, but any child younger than 14 **must** be accompanied by a parent or guardian

**What are my transport/parking options getting to the event?**

We&#8217;re 5 minutes walk from Europa Bus Centre, and Parking is available all across the Weavers Court Campus

**What should I bring to the event?**

We don&#8217;t have the resources available to provide everyone with a machine, so if you can help us out by bringing your own device, be it laptop/tablet/smartphone, that&#8217;d be great.

**I can&#8217;t make it, what can I do to help?**

If you can&#8217;t make it to our Dojo, consider some of the other Dojos in Northern Ireland, like at BMC in [Belfast](http://zen.coderdojo.com/dojo/110), [Ballymena](http://zen.coderdojo.com/dojo/274), or the brand new Dojo in [Newry](http://zen.coderdojo.com/dojo/45).

If you just want to support our event here at Farset Labs, please consider making a donation to the charity and mention in your donation that you wish it to go to fund refreshments, resources, materials, and equipment for the Dojo.

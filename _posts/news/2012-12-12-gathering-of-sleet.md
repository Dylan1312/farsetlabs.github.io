After a wonderfully democratic [Doodle](http://doodle.com/rh4uhdhp2q4gk96c), distributed through our Twitter, Facebook, and IRC channels, the community has decided to have another, informal, &#8216;Gathering of Sleet&#8217; (aka Gathering of Lightning Event) squeezed into the year at very short notice.

This Sunday! (Thanks for that guys&#8230; :P)

Anyway, standard Gathering of Lightning rules apply:

*   <span style="line-height: 13px;">Flying pigs after 7 minutes</span>
*   No Presentation tools (Prezi, Powerpoint, Keynote, Beamer, etc)
*   Arbitrary order or presenters
*   HecklingÂ Encouraged

(Unconfirmed) Presentations offered by the community over the thought process of this so far are:

*   <span style="line-height: 13px;">Chrome OS: Are you ready to live in the cloud?</span>
*   Ruby/Javascript/Io/Twillo/Erlang/Go/Linguistics (One person offered these&#8230; brave lad)
*   Parallelism in Web Programming
*   Windows 8/Windows Mobile App Certification processes / pains
*   Dr Strangethings, or How I learned to stop worrying and love Rapid Prototyping
*   Probably more!

Since it&#8217;s short notice, we&#8217;ve got no sponsor for this one, but we&#8217;ll grab a few crates to drink and people are, as always, free to BYO Food/Drink.

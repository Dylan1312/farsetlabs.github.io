# Sorry!<img class="alignright  wp-image-961" alt="I-Am-Sorry-18" src="http://i1.wp.com/farsetlabs.org.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/I-Am-Sorry-18.jpg?resize=120%2C120" data-recalc-dims="1" />

Happy New Year!

And to kick things off, an apology; our provisionally scheduled Raspberry Jam on the 12th has been postponed until after the exam season as it&#8217;s been difficult to get people able to help out at the event. Raspberry Jam will return February

# GoL: Thur 17th Jan[<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-958" alt="light-wide" src="http://i1.wp.com/farsetlabs.org.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/light-wide-300x151.jpg?fit=300%2C151" data-recalc-dims="1" />][1]

Currently proposed (but not scheduled) topics include:

*   [Update] Brendan Drain from Brain and Nerd, who had recent success with [Predestination][2], will be talking about how he got started in Games Development (and what to avoid!)
*   [Update] Niall Bole, Engineer, Gamer, Organiser, and Placement student at NACCO will be talking about &#8216;Using [Fablabs][3] for Fun and Profit&#8217;
*   [Colin Kelsey][4], from QUB&#8217;s Centre for Plasma Physics, with what he describes as &#8220;either functional plasma physics or a big surprise&#8221;
*   Rebecca Lutton, a mechanical engineer of [Bright Club ][5]fame with &#8216;Observational Humerology &#8211; The curse of innuendo&#8217;
*   Andrew Bolster on getting your Raspberry Pi to talk to the real world using the [Gertboard][6]
*   Dylan Wylie, another Physicist, who is ambiguously talking about &#8216;[Quantum Theory, Maybe][7]&#8216;

As with all our lighting events, this is an open call, so even if you just want to say something on the night, we&#8217;ll have the blackboard grid up so can literally sign up to talk during the other talks.

We&#8217;ll also hopefully be live streaming this one&#8230; maybe&#8230;

# Global Game Jam Flacknite: Fri 25th[<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-959" alt="ggjlogo1dates" src="http://i2.wp.com/farsetlabs.org.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/ggjlogo1dates-300x52.png?fit=300%2C52" data-recalc-dims="1" />][8]

This time around we&#8217;re collaborating with the [University of Ulster&#8217;s Office of Innovation][9] to run the 2013 Northern Ireland [Global Game Jam][10]

The Global Game Jam (GGJ) is the world&#8217;s largest game jam event. Think of it as a hackathon focused on game development. It is the growth of an idea that in today’s heavily connected world, we could come together, be creative, share experiences and express ourselves in a multitude of ways using video games – it is very universal. The weekend stirs a global creative buzz in games… while at the same time exploring the process of development, be it programming, iterative design, narrative exploration or artistic expression. It is all condensed into a 48 hour development cycle. Although the event is heavily focused on programming, there are many other areas where people who don’t code can contribute to a game.

This is going to be an in-demand event so please register attendance beforehand!

Note that **Donations are not required for this event** as refreshment costs are covered by [UUOI][9], but donation tickets will go directly into the general Farset fund, for which we&#8217;ll be paying the bills to keep Farset going day-to-day!

# Raspberry Jam: Sat 9th Feb<a href="http://fsl-pijam-0213.eventbrite.com" rel="attachment wp-att-960"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-960" alt="logo" src="http://i1.wp.com/farsetlabs.org.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/logo-150x150.png?resize=150%2C150" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>

After the success of our last jam, and already falling behind our schedule due to a)Christmas and b) Exams, we&#8217;re finally bringing it back to life!

Raspberry Jam is a Farset Labs Members event, so visitors are expected to make a small donation either in the form of an online ticket, or chucking a few coins in the tin in person.

<div>
  <strong>You do not need to have a Raspberry Pi</strong> to come to a meeting. In fact, not having a Raspberry Pi is an excellent motive for coming along. You will discover what you can do with a Raspberry Pi when you do manage to get hold of one.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  Stuff we&#8217;ll be trying out:
</div>

<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      A &#8216;beginners guide&#8217; walk through of how to get started with your Pi
    </li>
    <li>
      Getting started with Hardware interfaces to the Raspberry Pi (including the [Gertboard](http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/1734))
    </li>
    <li>
      Some show-and-tell demonstrations of cool projects people have already done with their Pi&#8217;s
    </li>
    <li>
      Breaking to a relaxed evening of Pi-Jamming, where everyone is encouraged to share their experiences.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <div>
    Children are welcome to attend the event, when accompanied by a parent or guardian.
  </div>
  
  <div>
    We will try to get our hands on as many HDMI compatible monitors as we can, <strong>but please try and BYO monitor.</strong> We have plenty of mice and keyboards, but few HDMI compatible monitors.
  </div>

  <div>
    Also, if anyone would like to present any projects or just help out with the organisation of this event (or give feedback based on the last events) get in touch with us via events@farsetlabs.org.uk (or any of the dozen or so other ways you&#8217;ll be able to get us on!)

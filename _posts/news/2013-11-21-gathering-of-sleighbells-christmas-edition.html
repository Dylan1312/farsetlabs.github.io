Our long running, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignite_%28event%29">Ignite</a> / <a href="http://www.pechakucha.org/faq">Petcha Kutcha</a> -minus-the-presentations-plus-a-giant-blackboard-and-foam-projectiles speaker series is back, with a slightly festive feel! Normal rules apply; Speakers have 7 minutes to talk about something they're passionate about, with audience heckling encouraged, and the opportunity for a few more minutes of Q&amp;A after at the compères discretion. This time around, the wonderful <a href="https://twitter.com/clairedotw">Claire Wilgar </a>will be compère-ing (we expect Christmas Hats!) and for a change we have a rough idea of whose talking!
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://jiannhughes.com/" target="_blank">Jiann Hughes</a> will be talking about her work in the intersection between Art, Culture, and Technology</li>
	<li>Colin Kelsey/Matt Hazely will be explaining some of the beer brewing techniques they are experimenting with in the labs</li>
	<li>Will Burr from Billy Goat Entertainment will be demoing some of his currently-<a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1236117571/her-majestys-spiffing" target="_blank">Kickstarting</a> game, Her Majesty's Spiffing</li>
	<li>Dr David Laverty, for Queen's University Belfast's Energy, Power and Intelligent Systems (EPIC) group, who are working on<a href="https://www.facebook.com/QUBEV" target="_blank"> converting a classic DeLorean to an Electric drive train</a></li>
	<li>Sebastian Heinz from SARC will <strong>hopefully</strong> be demoing his wildly successful <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2012099678/patchblocks-programmable-mini-synth-modules" target="_blank">Patchblocks</a> project that has already obliterated its £10k funding goal</li>
	<li>We'll also <strong>hopefully</strong> have a visit from some developers from <a href="http://www.aepona.com" target="_blank">Aepona</a>, a locally based API-as-a-service company recently acquired by <a href="http://www.aepona.com/intel-and-aepona/" target="_blank">Intel</a></li>
	<li>Finally, we're <strong>hoping</strong> to get a short talk on some of the work done by PWC's Belfast Based Digital Forensic Team</li>
</ul>
As always, we try to keep a few slots open for walk ins, so if you feel inspired to talk about something, let us know! Drinks and munchies are provided by the brilliant folks at the <a href="http://www.bcs.org/category/10444" target="_blank">British Computing Society</a>, who have supported us throughout our <a title="Gathering of Lightning" href="http://farsetlabs.org.uk/blog/gathering-of-lightening/" target="_blank">Gathering of Lightning</a> programme for the past year and a half.

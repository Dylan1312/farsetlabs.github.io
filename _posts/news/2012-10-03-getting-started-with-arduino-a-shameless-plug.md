Have you wanted to fiddle with electronics but don&#8217;t have the equipment or knowledge?<img class="alignright  wp-image-682" title="Massimo Bazai" src="http://i2.wp.com/farsetlabs.org.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/5537363317_7ee0c04ac4.jpg?resize=119%2C180" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" />

Last were contacted by an Italian Maker-collective called 

[WeFab.it](http://www.wefab.it/), who are associated with the fantastic [Arduino](http://arduino.cc/) project for electronics experimentation and prototyping.

They were kindly letting us know about a new RS sponsored video series walking through RS&#8217;s new [Arduino Starter Kit](http://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/processor-microcontroller-development-kits/7617355/?) (£67), presented by Arduino co-founder [Massimo Banzi](http://www.massimobanzi.com/) (yes, that is his real surname).

On Monday, they presented their first video, &#8220;Get to know your tools&#8221;. The video explains how to build a basic circuit with the Arduino board, and how to use each of the basic components such as LEDs, switches, and resistors. So if you are new to electronics, this is a must!



They&#8217;ve got a programme of 10 videos lined up, finishing up with a Twitter Controlled Mood Lamp, which we here at Farset Labs will be really interested to see, considering our occasionally depressed Nabaztag&#8230;

We&#8217;ve been walking a few of the drop-ins through similar circuits, and these videos are going to be a great resource for education. And the Starter packs look pretty darned handy too&#8230;

Disclaimer: Depending on the community response to these videos, we&#8217;re investigating getting a few of the educational packs for the space, so if you&#8217;d be interested in this, PLEASE let us know in the comments section!

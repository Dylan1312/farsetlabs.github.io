[Gathering of Lightning][1], Farset Labs&#8217; highly successful ad-hoc presentation series, is coming back after a Freshers Hiatus, again, in collaboration with The [British Computing Society](http://www.bcs.org/category/10444), 7pm to 9pm on Thursday the 25th of October.

<!--more-->

The format is the same as before:

*   Speakers have a maximum of **7 minutes** to speak on the subject of their choice. This will be** enforced with projectiles** this time.
*   The Use of **Non-Projected** Visual Aids is heavily encouraged (but if you really need a power point, that&#8217;s ok too, **it&#8217;s just not very cool**)
*   On the night, presenters (planned or unplanned) are invited to put a 3-5 word synopsis of their topic on the blackboard
*   The Compère will decide what order in which presentations will be done, **so be nice to him/her**
*   Punishment for rule/time violators is **at the disgression of the sponsor**, in this case the BCS

Currently proposed (but not scheduled) topics include:

*   Garage **Beer** Brewing
*   The **Media** Community in Northern Ireland
*   BBC CPR &#8211; Micro **Resuscitation**
*   **BCS** Reborn
*   Circuit **Bending** Killed The Video Star
*   AND **MOAR**

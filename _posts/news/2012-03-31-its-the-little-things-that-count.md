What we&#8217;re seeing however are some pretty big-ticket items, which is great, but we also need the small stuff. Grouped together, the items that are listed below are pretty costly, but individually, they&#8217;re very cheap. Donating something from this list is a great way to get involved if you can&#8217;t afford to donate something bigger.<!--more--> So, without further ado, here are a list of essential, but not immediately obvious items that we need as a matter of urgency:

*   Mugs and glasses (the plainer the better and matching stuff would be awesome, but we&#8217;ll take what we get as long as it isn&#8217;t damaged)
*   Plates and bowls (as above)
*   Cutlery
*   Cleaning products (Fairy, bleach, Dettol, cloths)
*   Clean plastic sheeting (for any painting and for workshop use later)
*   Bins (both for paper/office stuff and a kitchen bin)
*   Handwash (not bars of soap)
*   Decent power strips (preferably with individual on/off switches and anti-surge)
*   Desk lamps
*   Hand tools

<div>
  Items on the list will get crossed out as we get enough of them in, so that we don&#8217;t have storage issues. Thanks in advance!

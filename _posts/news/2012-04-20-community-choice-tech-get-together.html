As we creep up towards 100 Facebook likes, it's about time that we started some proper community events on a regular basis.

<a title="Doodle" href="http://ow.ly/apDwg" target="_blank">When do you want to have a weekly tech-get-together in the Event Space?</a>

We want to open up the space to our community, just to chill out and chat about their working/playing week in a relaxed environment. We'll try and provide some munchies and refreshments, as well as a few toys to experiment with.

Also, for anyone watching, We've enabled online purchasing for <a title="Membership" href="http://farsetlabs.org.uk/blog/membership/" target="_blank">Monthly Individual memberships</a>, and enabled a donation button on our <a title="Farset Labs" href="http://farsetlabs.org.uk" target="_blank">Front Page</a>, so whether you can make it down or not, it's even easier to support what we're trying to do here.

Also, incase you missed it, check out our <a title="Events" href="http://farsetlabs.org.uk/blog/events/">Events</a> calendar for upcoming madness at Farset Labs

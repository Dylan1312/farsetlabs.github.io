Heat death is reversed, pigs fly, and satan skates to work.

And there&#8217;s a free lunch.

Our [SpringUp](http://springup.co) event this weekend has been a great success, but there is 0.74* Metric Tonnes of Subway, Boojum, and Discovery Wraps left over, so if you&#8217;re a Farset Labs member (Or suddenly feel the urge to sign up) come on, Â nom nom nom, and meet some of the folks who&#8217;ve been going over 24 hours and look at the pain behind their eyes as you wolf down a sammich!

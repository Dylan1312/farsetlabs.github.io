The date (and name) is set on the first All Ireland Maker Camp.

With hackers and makers from all over Ireland getting in buses and trundling off into the isolated Irish countryside for a weekend of geeking out, this promises to be a weekend not to be missed!

We&#8217;ll be representing the riotous north, and we&#8217;ll be trying to sort out transport, and since details are still very very fuzzy, check in on the Facebook [event][1] where we&#8217;ll be keeping up to date.

It&#8217;s time to get out of the space and relax for a change.

Farset Labs in association with the [Department of Culture, Arts, and Leisure&#8217;s](http://www.dcalni.gov.uk/) &#8220;Culture Month&#8221; are inviting makers, breakers, designers, fashionistas, hackers, painters, sculptors, teachers, and any other kind of practical creative to just &#8216;hang out&#8217;, and encourage serendipity.

Stuck in a creative rut? *There&#8217;s nothing better than bouncing your ideas off someone else from a completely different field.*

Looking for a new project? *The best ideas come at the interfaces between fields.*

Just want a drink?Â *They&#8217;ve got them too.*  

Also, if any organisations wish to support this cause by throwing some money behind the bar, give us a shout on events@farsetlabs.org.uk and we&#8217;ll give you plenty of PR consideration!

## **FAQs**

### **I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m the right kinda person to go to this&#8230;**

That&#8217;s not actually a question, but if you&#8217;ve made it this far, you probably are!

### **But I won&#8217;t know anyone! Is this another one of those horrible networking events?**

No, no agenda, just talk to people, say &#8220;Hello, I&#8217;m X, what do you make?&#8221; and -BOOM-&#8230; new friend city.

### **Can I bring stuff to show off?**

Yes, but it better be awesome cus noone likes a showoff&#8230; unless they&#8217;ve got blinking lights and shiny! But seriously, it&#8217;s a bar, be sensible about what you&#8217;re bringing&#8230;

### **Are there ID requirements or an age limit to enter the event?**

It&#8217;s a Bar, so 18+ only please

We&#8217;ve been doing our research and we&#8217;re going to put in an order for custom embroidered clothing. We&#8217;re pretty sure we&#8217;ve covered the main items that people will want, but if you really want to get something else done, give me a shout at david (at) farsetlabs.org.uk and I&#8217;ll see what can be done.

Currently we have the following garments available:

*Russel Outdoor Fleece Jacket* &#8211; £30  
[http://www.our-catalogue.com/CCOC/?p=8700M][1] (Male)  
[http://www.our-catalogue.com/CCOC/?p=8700F][2] (Female)

*Regatta Reversible Fleece/Waterproof Jacket* &#8211; £45  
[http://www.our-catalogue.com/CCOC/?p=RG126][3]

*Premier Work Coat (Lab Coat)* &#8211; £35  
[http://www.our-catalogue.com/CCOC/?p=PR601][4]

*Result Classic Soft Shell Jacket* &#8211; £45  
[http://www.our-catalogue.com/CCOC/?p=RS121][5] (Male)  
[http://www.our-catalogue.com/CCOC/?p=RS122F][5] (Female)

*Beechfield Acrylic Knitted Hat* &#8211; £10  
<http://www.our-catalogue.com/CCOC/?p=BB45>

**If you&#8217;re interested, fill out the form: [Farset Labs Custom Apparel][6]**

The form will be open until 5pm on Thursday 25th April. Funds *must* be in by this date or your order will be dropped. Once the order is placed (likely on Friday 26th), it will be two to three weeks until the garments are delivered to Farset.

The Farset logo will be embroidered on the left breast of the clothing (centred on the hat) and any custom text you may want embroidered will be on the right breast. When you&#8217;re choosing the colour of the garment, remember the Farset logo colours so that there&#8217;s appropriate matching.

Now, go get yourself some *style.*

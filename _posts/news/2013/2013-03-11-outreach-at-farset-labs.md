This is going to sound old hat, but here at Farset, we&#8217;re all about cultivating an environment where the next generation of technologists can come into their own, but as the old saying goes, to teach is to learn twice.

That&#8217;s why we are always encouraging not only peer-teaching within the space and at Farset events, but also try and encourage our members to take part in STEM outreach to local schools.

As such, we&#8217;ve been internally working on a [semi-regularly-updated wiki of the STEM events that need help in Northern Ireland](http://unit1.farsetlabs.org.uk/wiki/index.php/Outreach_Projects), and hopefully, people will step up to the plate and give their time and energy to the next generation of technologists.

And before you say &#8220;That&#8217;s the teachers job&#8221;, just think back to your own teachers. Did they really know about the latest and greatest technologies going on?

*   Did your IT teacher show you how to deploy RoR services on [cloud based LAMP stacks](http://www.golygon.com/2010/11/tutorial-ruby-on-rails-hosted-on-amazon-cloud/)?
*   Did your technology teacher show you how to put an [accelerometer and GPS on a Raspberry Pi ](http://www.instructables.com/id/Preliminary-SPI-on-the-Pi-Communicating-with-a-/)to act as a vehicle data logger?
*   Did your Geography teacher show you have to use GOV.UK open data resources to [map GIS data in real-time](http://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/transport/around/buses/realtime.htm)?

I bet they didn&#8217;t (obviously replace those with temporally relevant technologies&#8230;).

As an aside, we&#8217;re trying to find someone to fund travel expenses for such outreach, because we definitely can&#8217;t! But if you&#8217;re free at any of the listed times, don&#8217;t hesitate to get in touch with us or the listed contact points on the wiki and give back to the education system.

    This mate-extract based soft-drink has carved a niche in hacker- and maker culture across the globe, and now, Northern Ireland

Farset Labs is proud to announce that we will be the first people to bring the amazing [Club Mate][1] caffineated soft-drink to the hallowed shores of Northern Ireland.

This low-impact, all natural energy drink is renowned within hacker-culture across the globe (having powered the author through a 76 hour straight volunteer-fest at [The Next HOPE][2] without any crashes or heavy-buzzes&#8230;).

However, because noone else has imported it before, and we all know how painful it can be to get things delivered to Northern Ireland, we&#8217;re making a concerted effort to put in a big order to reduce per-crate delivery costs. As such, we&#8217;re inviting the community to buy in to our purchasing consortium at cost-price (rounded up&#8230;) on a per-crate level (£33 for 24x330ml, £35 for 20x500ml).

If you&#8217;re interested, just fill in [THIS FORM][3]. This buy-in is open to non-Farset members and to groups of people clubbing together to buy crates but we will not be selling by the bottle at this point.

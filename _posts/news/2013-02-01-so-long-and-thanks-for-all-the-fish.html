<p>It's with a heavy heart that I have to announce that I'm stepping down as a Director of Farset Labs.</p>
<p>Simply put, the intersection between the time investment required to continue my role in Farset has intersected with the time requirements of my PhD.</p>
<p>I want to thank everyone who has made this ride so rewarding and, while occasionally stressful, fun. I have no doubt (as Rachel keeps reminding me) that I'll be back later, but for the time being, I have to concentrate on one thing at a time, and unfortunately Farset Labs doesn't pay me with anything that I can buy bacon with.</p>
<p>David and Eoghan (and hopefully a third that I've left up to their choosing) will continue their sterling control of Farset Labs both as a fiscally stable charity, and as a community of some of the greatest minds and people that I've ever had the pleasure to meet.</p>
<p>One last passing comment, since I suppose by this point I've 'officially' resigned, so my comments from this point on can't be taken as the comments of the organisation as a whole...</p>
<p>The Northern Ireland Culture, be it Business or Personal, has stood in the way of what I was trying to do at Farset Labs. The simultaneous assumption of the general populace that everything is publically funded so it must be free/cheap, combined with what I can only describe as chronic bureaucracy crossed with Helen Keller-levels of short-sightedness from the political and business communities respectively has made this journey one of the hardest things I've ever done in my entire life. When it is easier to get funding to convene a consultative panel to meet to discuss ways to develop a long-term reconciliation programme for technical redevelopment of the region than to pay for a few dozen raspberry pi's, or to pay the travel costs to send researchers to schools, this province, and indeed the organisations 'responsible' for it's development, have a lot to answer for.</p>
<p>With what currently stands as seven thousand pounds of community funding (including the expense of a spurious two thousand pound lawsuit...) Farset Labs has done more to develop the next generation of technical and entrepreneurial leaders per pound spent than any other organisation by several orders of magnitude. Of that I am proud.</p>
<p>To David and Eoghan, I say only this. I wish I could carry on the road ahead with you, but I know you'll carry it well.</p>

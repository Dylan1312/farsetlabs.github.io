<strong>Heavy draft, in-cognitive thoughts splattered all over page, re-read, revise, and repeat.</strong>

Farset Labs now has <a title="Farset Discourse" href="http://discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk" target="_blank">a community that is self aware</a>.  This never happened before. A long time ago, I remember I had no friends. What I really mean is, my friends weren't interested in pulling apart Sega Mega Drives or making trip alarms.  I sometimes felt I was unique in my desire to learn by taking things apart and shoving the parts under the bed, but it turns out, many shared the same story. The very nature of our hobby requires space, time alone to work, and being free from distraction. This is in my opinion one of the largest reasons why in our younger years, tinkerers and hackers are commonly withdrawn, detached from society norms, and unsure about our own abilities.  We had few to share our discoveries with - had anyone had dared asked what I was working on I would have been very animated on the project, would I not bore people to tears with the detail.

</ul>
Oh how Farset Labs has changed things.  Not only is there a wide open space for me to spread my work all over, but people can see it.  Suddenly, people can see what I do and are genuinely interested in it.  Some people will say my projects are cool. And people ask about my projects and I tell them, I tell them everything that I think is cool and then I tell them more, and then someone else asks and I have to tell them all over again. I see someone else's project and I think it's cool, I talk to them about it, and talk to others about it, and everyone starts to become vaguely aware of what everyone's working on down at the space.  But on Facebook, if someone so much as cooks eggs for dinner everyone knows ALL about it. Farset Labs would have been perfectly fitted in the mid-80's when the electronic tinkerers were booming in numbers and you still rang your mate to go and do stuff together.  Though communication has moved on a lot in the past 30 YEARS and suddenly, we're all connected. <strong>Possible restart of this whole thing below.</strong> When Farset Labs launched, there was no community.  There was only people.
<ul>
	<li>Common problem with hackerspaces is the lack of interaction between social rejects</li>
	<li>Remaining issues with lack of scope on the wider farset community
<ul>
	<li>Awareness of other member projects</li>
	<li>Equipment sharing</li>
	<li>Putting a voice on issues</li>
	<li>Eating burgers</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Discourse solves:</li>
	<li>People becoming aware of others projects</li>
	<li>People have the chance to learn from all other projects</li>
	<li>People can get or give valuable input on projects</li>
</ul>

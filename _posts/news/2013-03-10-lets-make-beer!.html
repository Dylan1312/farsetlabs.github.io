Recently, I pitched a question on the Farset Facebook page asking did anyone want to make beer.

The response was frighteningly large and quick... but then what should I expect? I said two words that Farset members cannot walk away from; 'beer' and 'make'.

So tomorrow night, thats <strong>Monday 11th March 2013</strong>, at <strong>6.30pm</strong>, I am calling all interested parties to the table. Yes, thats the wonky table in the back corner of Farset.

At this table, we will look at all the equipment that has been donated so far (which is a lot), discuss what extra equipment we need to buy/steal/acquire, discuss the next steps and generally how we will move forward.

To quote the upstanding citizen that was Frank Zappa:

"You can't be a real country unless you have a beer and an airline. It helps if you have some kind of a football team, or some nuclear weapons, but at the very least you need a beer."

See you there.

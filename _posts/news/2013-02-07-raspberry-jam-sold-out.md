Aaaand, we&#8217;re sold out of &#8216;In-Person Donation&#8217; tickets for this weekends [Raspberry Jam][1]!<img class="alignleft" alt="Sorry, Sold Out" src="http://i0.wp.com/kevinconroysmith.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/sold-out.jpg?resize=220%2C220" data-recalc-dims="1" />

We&#8217;ve got 24 on the docket at the minute and if anyone wants to join, a small donation will go a long way to keep this volunteer run, [community driven][2], self-funded operation of ours going.

Of course, if you want to be guaranteed free tickets at this or any of our future events, [Membership][3] starts at just £15/month for students and £25/month for non-students.

These memberships pay exclusively for rent, heating, lighting, power and network infrastructure and are essential to Farset&#8217;s continued success. There are no salaries&#8230;

Also, we&#8217;re eagerly awaiting delivery of our [LEDBorgs][4], which we will be using this weekend to show how you can make your own internet-controlled mood-light by way of an introduction to GPIO on the Raspberry Pi.

If any organisations or companies would be interested in sponsoring future Raspberry Jam&#8217;s or any of Farset Labs&#8217; other [events][5], or joining as a [Corporate Member][6], get in touch with us, and while you&#8217;re thinking about it, check out the [awesome press][7] we&#8217;ve got so far in our short life!

All the best, and see you on Saturday!

The Farset Labs team is still in the space at one in the morning &#8211; now that&#8217;s dedication!

[<img class="alignright  wp-image-176" title="IMAG0159" src="http://i1.wp.com/farsetlabs.org.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/IMAG0159.jpg?resize=210%2C125" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" />][1]We went in this morning with no working network, no backbone connection, little equipment and no computers running. Over fourteen hard hours later, we now have every viable socket networked, switches installed, WiFi running, our [Tibus][2] internet connection enabled, a PowerEdge running [ESXi][3] with virtual machines, the [RM1][4] up and booted and some new equipment donated. The plumbers have been in and mostly fitted out the remaining toilet and we&#8217;re expecting the cooker shortly. The plumbing should be finished by Thursday night/Friday morning and the spark will be in again tomorrow to finish his work.

The space is still unquestionably in beta itself, but we&#8217;re proud of it and we think you&#8217;ll find it&#8217;s rustic (aka, structurally-supported-entirely-by-plaster), but charming. It&#8217;s going to be an amazing home for the tech community in Belfast and I cannot wait for our doors to open officially at 3pm on Friday.

See you all then &#8211; I think we may go to bed soon!

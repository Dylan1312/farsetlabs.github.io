As we creep up towards 100 Facebook likes, it&#8217;s about time that we started some proper community events on a regular basis.

[When do you want to have a weekly tech-get-together in the Event Space?](http://ow.ly/apDwg)

We want to open up the space to our community, just to chill out and chat about their working/playing week in a relaxed environment. We&#8217;ll try and provide some munchies and refreshments, as well as a few toys to experiment with.

Also, for anyone watching, We&#8217;ve enabled online purchasing for <a title="Membership" href="http://farsetlabs.org.uk/blog/membership/" target="_blank">Monthly Individual memberships</a>, and enabled a donation button on our [Front Page](http://farsetlabs.org.uk), so whether you can make it down or not, it&#8217;s even easier to support what we&#8217;re trying to do here.

Also, incase you missed it, check out our [Events][1] calendar for upcoming madness at Farset Labs

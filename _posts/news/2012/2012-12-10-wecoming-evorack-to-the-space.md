[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-924" title="bigicon-contact" src="http://i2.wp.com/farsetlabs.org.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/bigicon-contact.png?fit=385%2C200" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" />][1]Farset Labs would like to introduce our latest corporate member, [Evorack](http://www.evorack.com)!

Owned and operated by Belfast firm [ABPNI Computer Solutions Ltd,](http://www.abpni.co.uk/) and run by our own member Jonny Tripathy (don&#8217;t worry, he&#8217;s still paying membership as well!), Evorack provides Linux and Windows virtual server hosting solutions based on the open source[ Xen Hypervisor ](http://www.xen.org/products/xenhyp.html)platform.

In conjunction with Evorack&#8217;s infrastructure and experience, Farset Labs hopes to roll-out server hosting tools to our members, enabling them to develop, test, build (and break) cool cloud apps and services.

With the number of new innovations in web-based apps and services having some sort of cloud back-end, it is only natural that Farset provides these resources to our members.

Over the next days we&#8217;ll be transferring much of our web infrastructure to Evorack, and implementing member level, private web storage, VPN, and community application servers. As with most things there may be a few hiccups&#8230; But we&#8217;ll make it through.

Anyway, welcome on board guys!

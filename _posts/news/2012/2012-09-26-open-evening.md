All the time, we&#8217;re talking to people about what we do at Farset Labs, and often, when we talk about our amazing community, people have two reactions:

1.  Awesome! These people can help me learn and grow!
2.  Ahh crap, I don&#8217;t want to butt in on their clique

<div>
  And so, to try and fix that secondary fear, we&#8217;re having an informal Open Evening for anyone interested in coming down and checking the place out. There will be drinks and noms and projects to tinker with, so if you&#8217;ve been &#8216;undecided&#8217; for a while; now is the opportunity to see for yourself why this is such a great place to work/play!

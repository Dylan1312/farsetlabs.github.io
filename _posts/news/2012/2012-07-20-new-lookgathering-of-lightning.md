We all loved the idea of Gathering Of Lightning, but the PR for it was slightly neglected (mea culpa). Not this time!

On Tuesday, 31st, we&#8217;re doing it all over again. Beer, Pizza, and Lightning fast discussions from a range of selected speakers from our own community.

While there will be plenty of time to chat on the day, if you want to &#8216;book&#8217; a speaking slot, get in touch in any of the dozen or so ways that are available!

After a long stint as our effective critical infrastructure ([wiki][5], [redmine][6], [spaceapi][7], [big red button][8]), the old[ fsl-eee7][9] was retired after an uptime of over 100 Days. All major functionality has now been moved to the much higher spec&#8217;ed Farbot.

We&#8217;ve now got two in-house [Raspberry Pis][10] for any members to fiddle with. Ask one of the Directors and they&#8217;ll usually know where one of them is!

The Eventspace lighting is being updated, but even in the midst of that we were happy to host the[ BBCNI Creative Collisions Event][11], which was, in the words of the organisers, &#8216;a lot more successful than we had expected&#8217;.

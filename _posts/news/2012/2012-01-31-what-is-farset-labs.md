Over the years, several attempts have been made at making a [Hackerspace/Makerspace ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace) in Belfast, the aims of which were slightly different but centred around creating a shared experimental facility for the NI tech community. Some people have called it a &#8216;Geek Gym&#8217;, or a &#8216;Tech Playground&#8217;, others have called it &#8216;An Amateur Version of the [NITC](http://www.qub.ac.uk/sites/nitc/)&#8216; but finally, Farset Labs is near realising that goal. Whichever goal that is.

A strong community of technical students and professionals has worked on this for many months (in some [cases](http://www.andrewbolster.info/blog/2010/07/belfast_hackerspac/) years), and we&#8217;re getting near the finish line.

We are going to build a space where people of all technical interests and experiences can come together to work on [crazy individual or group projects](http://hackaday.com/). A space where people who may not be exposed to the latest and greatest bleeding edge computing technologies, can experiment with them in a [near-enterprise server environment](http://xen.org/products/cloudxen.html) without having to piss off the boss. A space where where those ideas that would otherwise need lots of [additional equipment][1], can be rapidly built and tested, in a relaxed environment. A space where people can [chill out](http://farsetlabs.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Hammock/88503-17839) between projects and [play with Legos](http://www.pcworld.com/article/248725/lego_minecraft_set_is_one_step_closer_to_reality_geeks_rejoice.html).

It&#8217;s taken time to get this far, and it&#8217;s going to take a lot of time and community support to make this successful.

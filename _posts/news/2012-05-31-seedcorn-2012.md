Farset Labs is a mix of people with a mix of ambitions. Some want a high flying career, some want a steady existance, and some want to jump off a cliff and build a plane on the way down.

If you&#8217;re one of the latter ones, you might be interested in the [ITI SeedCorn ][1]competition. Long story short, it&#8217;s a business plan competition for up and coming SME&#8217;s, entrepreneurs or just people with an idea, competing for a share of €280,000 in funding, as[  
][2] well as a wealth of mentorship support and advice.

If you want more information, or just want to get a feel for the competition, they&#8217;re having a free [briefing day][3] on Wed 6th. (NOTE The venue has changed from the Holiday Inn to the [Momentum offices on Ravenhill Road][4])

Best of luck, and don&#8217;t forget your old friends Farset when you make it big!

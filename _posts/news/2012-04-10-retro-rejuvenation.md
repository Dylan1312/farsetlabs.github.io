Today saw even more donations come in, especially of some really cool old gaming hardware. So we&#8217;ve taken a rush of blood to the head and decided to take them all out of their boxes tomorrow (Tuesday), put them out on tables and have a play.

You&#8217;re more than welcome to join us and explore vintage systems or sit and work at your own projects. Watch the Twitter feed to see when we open up (it&#8217;ll be late morning)!

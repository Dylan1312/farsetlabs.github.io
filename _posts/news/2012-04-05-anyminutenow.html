<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-186" title="The Store" src="http://farsetlabs.org.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/2012-04-02-18.21.47-300x179.jpg" alt="Equipment in the store" width="300" height="179" />Another day of frantic work and continuous driving has brought us much closer to our launch tomorrow. The plumbers have completely fitted the toilets to a great standard and the electricians are making sense of the circuits around the building; the puzzle pieces that were outside our control have pretty much fallen into place. After a long day driving to collect tables, hoovering endless dust and generally cleaning up, we're about to pack up for the night, exhausted.

We've fitted out the reception area with a little more server equipment and a slightly fancier network configuration, and have the water supply turned on, making the space a lot more pleasant to be in. The contractors are finishing up and our outer window frames received a welcome coat of paint. Windows were scraped and the equipment store was further populated.

Tomorrow morning, final preparations include the plumbers and electricians finishing up, the hopeful delivery of our electric cooker, preparations for the rooms and general last-minute cleaning.

We can't wait to see you all at our <a title="Launch Event" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/191615090954138/">launch event</a> tomorrow at 3pm!

Farset Labs is proud to announce that we will be the first people to bring the amazing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club-Mate">Club Mate</a> caffineated soft-drink to the hallowed shores of Northern Ireland.

This low-impact, all natural energy drink is renowned within hacker-culture across the globe (having powered the author through a 76 hour straight volunteer-fest at <a href="http://thenexthope.org/">The Next HOPE</a> without any crashes or heavy-buzzes...).

However, because noone else has imported it before, and we all know how painful it can be to get things delivered to Northern Ireland, we're making a concerted effort to put in a big order to reduce per-crate delivery costs. As such, we're inviting the community to buy in to our purchasing consortium at cost-price (rounded up...) on a per-crate level (£33 for 24x330ml, £35 for 20x500ml).

If you're interested, just fill in <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1fUgrvDnktPW1WM3YsBpFMWUZP5qGrD7Ktu1vsmCVp4s/viewform">THIS FORM</a>. This buy-in is open to non-Farset members and to groups of people clubbing together to buy crates but we will not be selling by the bottle at this point.

After a healthy summer break, it&#8217;s time to get CoderDojo back on the event list, but in the true hacker spirit, we&#8217;ve got to fiddle with things.

We&#8217;re trying a new timeslot that could be great or could be a disaster; Friday afternoons, **starting this week**. Get your tickets [here](http://fsl-dojo.eventbrite.co.uk/).

We would also insist that all mentors planning on attending register in advance. This is so that we can ensure a safe environment for the children and young adults attending the event.

It&#8217;s short notice and it&#8217;s a change from our &#8216;normal schedule&#8217;, but hopefully we&#8217;ll see you then!

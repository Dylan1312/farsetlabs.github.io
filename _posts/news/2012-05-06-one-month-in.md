Well, that&#8217;s not entirely true; Farset Labs has several ages&#8230;<!--more-->

*   3 weeks since our first big event ([SpringUp][1])
*   3 weeks and 1 day since we got heating
*   1 month in the building (officially)
*   36 days in the building from first &#8216;preparation&#8217;
*   2 months since first discussions with Weavers Court
*   3 months since registration with companies house / HMRC
*   6 months since the property hunt went into full swing (cheers to Eoghan, David, and Conor; a cracking property-survey team)
*   7 months of operating with the name &#8216;Farset Labs&#8217;
*   10 months of running hackathon events with [QUESTS][2] and QUB [Dragonslayers](http://www.dragonslayers.org.uk/)
*   12 months since founding QUESTS
*   19 months of regular &#8216;Pub&#8217; meetings with the local tech community, spawning off some great projects and ideas along the way.
*   21 months since I came back from America full of energy and optimism
*   21 months and 19 days since I wrote the first entry on the [Belfast Hackerspace Working Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/belfast-hackspace-working-group/KJw3A8uAdXA), lying in a hammock at the Pennsylvania Hotel, NY, at [TheNextHope](http://thenexthope.org/)

And we&#8217;ve done brilliantly. I want to personally thank everyone who has been involved in this effort over all this time and hope that we&#8217;ll continue to make this even more awesome than it already is.

Coming up is what looks to become our flagship regular event; [FlackNite](https://www.facebook.com/events/340108216053357/); an intensive &#8216;lock-in&#8217; (no, we won&#8217;t lock you in) where members, old and new, can come and work on their projects and showcase them to their peers. We&#8217;re working to get some &#8216;VIP&#8217;s over, but mum&#8217;s the word on that for the time being. Since we&#8217;re making this up as we go along, we welcome any and all advice/ideas/insults as to how we&#8217;re doing things.

Work progresses on the CCTV and Access Control (RFID) system, and the User Management System (tasty tasty karma) is under-way. Hopefully the directors will be able to stop working at some point and start doing our own projects, but not yet! We&#8217;re doing this for you!

So, tell your friends, tell your family, tell your boss, tell your colleagues, tell your lecturer, tell your classmates,

Farset Labs is here to stay.

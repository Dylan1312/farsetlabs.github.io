Friday 6th April, 1500 &#8211; Saturday 7th April 1500

This is our &#8216;soft launch&#8217; event running with no equipment, no budget, very little furniture, no PR and a case of beer.

Entry will be **Â£5, or Free for members** (Sign-up will be available on-site, hint hint), and we&#8217;ll try and get some munchies/a few drinks in for everyone.

Repeat: *We will have very few toys other than what can be donated*, but we finally have a space with power and a network.

We can hack the building together (or apart, within reason) and start bringing the dream alive.<!--more-->

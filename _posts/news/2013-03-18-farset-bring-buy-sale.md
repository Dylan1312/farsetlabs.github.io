It’s a great chance to pass on those things you can’t bring yourself to get rid of, or to grab something exciting for a bit of a bargain.

It’s also an opportunity for any creative types who’d like to grab a spot to showcase their talents to a different audience &#8211; baking, art, whatever you can create you can sell (though let’s try to keep it legal!)

Members and non-members will be buying and selling things in the event space all morning. Table spots are free for members or non-members, so if you’d like a spot to sell your things sign yourself up on the [Eventbrite page][2]. Entry to the event will be free, though donations are always welcome of course, so just turn up between 10:00 &#8211; 13:00 and see how many things you can buy and manage to transport home.

Farset Labs is planning on running an event to introduce any person of any age to embedded programming; spanning from building your own controller board that you can take home, right up to programming it with some basic functionality. But we want to get the community&#8217;s opinion before we set anything in stone.

Please, take a minute of your time to fill out [this survey](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDhWWGdhdG1VRDRxNVZvQ0czUHJSWVE6MQ) so we can make the best event for you.<!--more-->

In other news,

*   We broke through 100 [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/farsetlabs) Likes last week, and no one noticed;
*   [SpringUp](http://springup.co) was a fantastic success, and we welcome the winning/runner-up teams, Al.rg and betExpertise to their free memberships;
*   Our open/closed status is now listed on the [Global Hackerspace Wall](http://hackerspaces.me/wall) and our [Front Page](http://www.farsetlabs.org.uk) (which got a little redesign last week);
*   Our trip to the [ITE Titans](http://syncni.com/news/p.php?id=6182) event at [The Titanic Belfast](http://www.titanicbelfast.com/Home.aspx) was a very interesting evening for all involved;
*   Confirmed our Charitable Status (XT33366 if anyone cares) and we secured our Rates-exempt status (making the financial future a little less foggy);
*   Rolled out our temporary online membership / donation system (donation button is over that > way > \*hint\*);
*   Set up a [Wiki](http://unit1.farsetlabs.org.uk/wiki) to manage the internals of the space (work very much in progress);
*   Set up a [Redmine](http://unit1.farsetlabs.org.uk/redmine/) Project Management system (again, work in progress).

So, all in all, it&#8217;s starting to come together.

In ten days we&#8217;ll close out our &#8216;Founding Member&#8217; list &#8211; on the 6th of May, Farset Labs is a month old. Every member who signed up in that time will have their name (or username, if desired [and SFW]) laser etched into a metal plate that will hang in the Labs for as long as they survive.

So, if you&#8217;ve been on the fence about joining, now&#8217;s the time to <a title="Membership" href="http://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/blog/" target="_blank">sign up</a>. And remember, pop in any time* to check the place out.

\*No, we are not 24/7 yet, just watch the [Status](http://unit1.farsetlabs.org.uk/status.html) page.

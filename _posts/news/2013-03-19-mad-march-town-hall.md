**Monday March 25th @ 1900 in the Event Space**

It&#8217;s that time again, where democracy (otherwise known as &#8220;He who shows up, wins&#8221;) reigns supreme.

We&#8217;ll be doing the usual financial reporting, strategic reporting, etc, but this time round, we really want to encourage the membership to raise any issues they&#8217;re having with the space, the community, or the organisation in general.

For mundane things that you&#8217;re not worried about people talking about, simply add them to the &#8220;Members items to be raised&#8221; section on the relevant [wiki page][1]Â (or discuss existing items on that pages [Talk page](http://unit1.farsetlabs.org.uk/wiki/index.php?title=Talk:Town_Hall/1303&action=edit))

Alternatively, if there&#8217;s something private you&#8217;d like to discuss with the directors, either contact them generally on admin@farsetlabs.org.uk, or individually on bolster@farsetlabs.org.uk, eoghan@farsetlabs.org.uk or david@farsetlabs.org.uk.

Finally, if there is anything you&#8217;d like to raise anonymously, we&#8217;ve set up the below form to submit your issues.

Farset Labs is what you make of it and we aren&#8217;t psychic; we can&#8217;t do it without you&#8217;re support, guidance, and ideas.

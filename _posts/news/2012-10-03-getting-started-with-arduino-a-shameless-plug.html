Have you wanted to fiddle with electronics but don't have the equipment or knowledge?<img class="alignright  wp-image-682" title="Massimo Bazai" src="http://farsetlabs.org.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/5537363317_7ee0c04ac4-198x300.jpg" alt="" width="119" height="180" />

<!--more-->Last were contacted by an Italian Maker-collective called <a title="WeFab.it" href="http://www.wefab.it/" target="_blank">WeFab.it</a>, who are associated with the fantastic <a href="http://arduino.cc/" target="_blank">Arduino</a> project for electronics experimentation and prototyping.

They were kindly letting us know about a new RS sponsored video series walking through RS's new <a title="Arduino Starter Kit" href="http://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/processor-microcontroller-development-kits/7617355/?" target="_blank">Arduino Starter Kit</a> (£67), presented by Arduino co-founder <a href="http://www.massimobanzi.com/" target="_blank">Massimo Banzi</a> (yes, that is his real surname).

On Monday, they presented their first video, "Get to know your tools". The video explains how to build a basic circuit with the Arduino board, and how to use each of the basic components such as LEDs, switches, and resistors. So if you are new to electronics, this is a must!

They've got a programme of 10 videos lined up, finishing up with a Twitter Controlled Mood Lamp, which we here at Farset Labs will be really interested to see, considering our occasionally depressed Nabaztag...

We've been walking a few of the drop-ins through similar circuits, and these videos are going to be a great resource for education. And the Starter packs look pretty darned handy too...

Disclaimer: Depending on the community response to these videos, we're investigating getting a few of the educational packs for the space, so if you'd be interested in this, PLEASE let us know in the comments section!

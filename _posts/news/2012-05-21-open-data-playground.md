Now that [Flacknite][1] is over with, we can have some relaxed hackery.<!--more-->

  
Open Data is the big buzzword of our day. And with connected health and data visualisation being similar scale buzzwords, we thought it&#8217;d be good to have a series of nice relaxed &#8216;Open Data Playground&#8217; events, where web devs, graphic designers, [\*QL][2] sorcerers, and Data mining enthusiasts can hang out and play with bits.

No pressure, no &#8216;sponsors&#8217;, no competitions. Just pure unadulterated geekery.

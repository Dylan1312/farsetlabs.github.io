Gathering of Lightning, Farset Labs&#8217; highly successful ad-hoc presentation series, is coming back!

7th March 1730-2000

This time around we&#8217;re working in collaboration with the [QUB Science Shop][1] to bring in some weird and wonderful presenters (on top of the usual bunch of miscreants).

<del>We&#8217;re still working on confirming an event sponsor so it may end up as a &#8216;please donate&#8217; event, but we&#8217;ll keep you posted!</del>

[BCS &#8211; Belfast Chapter][1] have confirmed that they will once again be providing refreshments for GoL, so be sure to register on their page too!

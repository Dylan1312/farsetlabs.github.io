After a healthy summer break, it's time to get CoderDojo back on the event list, but in the true hacker spirit, we've got to fiddle with things.

We're trying a new timeslot that could be great or could be a disaster; Friday afternoons, <strong>starting this week</strong>. Get your tickets <a href="http://fsl-dojo.eventbrite.co.uk/" target="_blank">here</a>.

We would also insist that all mentors planning on attending register in advance. This is so that we can ensure a safe environment for the children and young adults attending the event.

It's short notice and it's a change from our 'normal schedule', but hopefully we'll see you then!

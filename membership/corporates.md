While the majority of Farset Labs is maintained by the community, we are also
supported by local companies and bodies that recognise the transformational
effect that our resources, projects and initiatives can have on the local
community and economy. Corporate Members provide support or services
that help the membership, and each has the same voting power as only one
individual member. For their ongoing support and participation in our
community, we thank them on this page.


# Membership Impacts

For companies that think what we're doing is great, we offer them a way to help us financially in return for a similar level of involvement as normal individual membership. Each corporate membership has the same voting power as a single individual, to keep things community-focused.

Intel recently acquired Belfast based Aepona, whose awarding-winning software
platform bridges the enterprise with the network, enabling Service Providers
to offer communications, context, commerce and control features that enrich
business applications using cloud-based APIs. This allows Service Providers to
monetize their assets in new ways, and enterprises to easily embed mobile
intelligence into a diverse range of applications.

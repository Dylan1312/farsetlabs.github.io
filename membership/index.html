<h1>Benefits</h1>

<p>We’re funded mostly by the hackers, developers, creatives, inventors and entrepreneurs that use the space every day for their ideas, experiments, and projects. Every member has a say in what goes on and has voting powers in decisions made at Town Hall meetings. They also get access to all of our equipment and events, as well as the affiliation with great like-minded people.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>High-speed fibre Internet connection</strong> &amp; WiFi provided by Tibus</li>
  <li><strong>Hot-desking</strong> and access to the space anytime</li>
  <li><strong>Communal</strong> <strong>electronics equipment</strong>, tools, and components</li>
  <li><strong>Kitted-out workshop</strong> with a growing selection of hand tools &amp; machines</li>
  <li><strong>3D prototyping facilities</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Free entry</strong> to all Farset Labs events<sup id="fnref:events"><a href="#fn:events" class="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
  <li><strong>Free workshops</strong> on all sorts of topics, from soldering to accounting</li>
  <li><strong>Networking opportunities</strong> with the best and brightest in Belfast</li>
  <li><strong>Belonging</strong> to an intelligent and creative community</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="membership-dues">Membership Types</h1>

<p>There are three Individual Membership rates that we think represent three core uses of the space; </p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Students</strong> (£15pm), that are occasionally in the space during the day, mostly experiment in the evenings, and are strapped for cash <sup id="fnref:cards"><a href="#fn:cards" class="footnote">2</a></sup></li>
  <li><strong>Enthusiasts</strong> (£25pm), that regularly use the space in the evenings and make regular use of the equipment and space, less strapped for cash</li>
  <li><strong>Freelancers</strong> (£35pm), that are consistently in the space, regularly hot-desking with ongoing long term projects under their belts</li>
</ul>

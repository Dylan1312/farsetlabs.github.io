# Individual Benefits

We're funded mostly by the hackers, developers and inventors that use the space every day for their ideas and projects. Every member has a say in what goes on and has voting powers in decisions made at Town Hall meetings. They also get unlimited access to all of our equipment and events, as well as the affiliation with great like-minded people.

*   **High-speed fibre Internet connection** &amp; WiFi provided by Tibus
*   **Hot-desking** and access to the space anytime
*   **Communal** **electronics equipment**, tools, and components
*   **Kitted-out workshop** with a growing selection of hand tools &amp; machines
*   **3D prototyping facilities**
*   **Free entry** to _all_ Farset Labs events
*   **Free workshops** on all sorts of topics, from soldering to accounting
*   **Networking opportunities** with the best and brightest in Belfast
*   **Belonging** to an intelligent and creative community

# Membership Dues

There are three Individual Membership rates that we think represent three core uses of the space; 

* Students (£15pm), that are occasionally in the space during the day, mostly experiment in the evenings, and are strapped for cash [^cards]
* Entheusiasts (£25pm), that regularly use the space in the evenings and make regular use of the equipment and space, less strapped for cash
* Freelancers (£35pm), that are consistently in the space, regularly hot-desking with ongoing long term projects under their belts

We're currently moving to a new membership management system, but until then, [sign up here](http://farsetlabs.org.uk/blog/membership/) to join instantly!

**All Membership Dues go towards the core operation of the space; events and projects are normally funded by additional donations / sponsorships**
 
If you don't wish to use PayPal, or wish to pay for the discounted year-long memberships, contact us on [membership@farsetlabs.org.uk](mailto:membership@farsetlabs.org.uk) to discuss alternative payment systems

[^cards]: All student members must hold current, valid, student ID's for the duration of their membership at that level

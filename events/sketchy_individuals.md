#FAQs

## Is there an age limit to enter the event?

Sketchy Individuals is aimed loosely at the over 18â€™s, but any young person may attend if accompanied by a parent or guardian

## What are my transport/parking options getting to the event?

We're 5 minutes walk from Europa Bus Centre, and Parking is available all across the Weavers Court Campus

## What should I bring to the event?

We don't have the resources available to provide everyone with materials, so bringing your own notebooks, paints, pens etc is greatly appreciated.

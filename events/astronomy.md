Farset are happy to host Belfast-based astronomy and astrophotography events targeted at the new-comer. If you have a telescope or binoculars, please do bring them along for a great chance to look for objects in the sky. Wear warm clothes, as some of the evening will be spent outside, and hot drinks will be provided.

#FAQs

## Is there an age limit to enter the event?

Farsets Astronomy program is for everyone, but any under 18's wishing to attend must be accompanied by a parent or guardian

## What are my transport/parking options getting to the event?

We're 5 minutes walk from Europa Bus Centre, and Parking is available all across the Weavers Court Campus

## Is there a charge for the event

This event is free for Farset members. A Â£3 donation is suggested for non-members wishing to attend.

## What should I bring to the event?

We don't have the resources available to provide everyone with the best equipment, if you have your own telescope or binoculars, bringing them and sharing them with other attendees would be greatly appreciated.

If you just want to support our event here at Farset Labs, please consider making a donation to the charity and mention in your donation that you wish it to go to fund refreshments, resources, materials, and equipment for the programme.

<p>In this page we'll publish live or near live data on the space. These come and go over time as they are largely tied to member side-projects and can be changed without notice. </p>

<p>If something is dead, or you'd like to add something, chuck us a <a href="https://github.com/FarsetLabs/farsetlabs.github.io/issues/new">GitHub Issue</a> and someone will sort it!</p>

Note: This sensor is in the back of the workshop, which is usually unoccupied and unheated. <a href="http://discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk/t/space-energy-project/242/6">Link to Source</a>

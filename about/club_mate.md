[Club-Mate](http://www.clubmate.de/) is the refreshing hacker drink originating from Germany. It uses an extract from the Yerba-tea plant native to South America. [See why](http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/how-a-german-soda-became-hackers-fuel-of-choice) it's the popular drink of choice among hacker sub-communities.

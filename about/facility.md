# Facilities & Resources

[![](http://farsetlabs.org.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/IMG_1768_1-682x1024.jpg)](http://farsetlabs.org.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/IMG_1768_1.jpg)

The half-life of any project is around 14 days...

# The Basics

Farset Labs is a [makerspace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace) that
provides a place for creativity and technological tinkering. We're open to
everyone, no matter what you want to do, and we welcome people from all walks
of life to use our space, come to our events, and get involved at a low level
to foster the maker community in Northern Ireland.

For a low membership fee, students, hobbyists, and all members of the local community will be able to come together, hack at projects, build stuff and bring some life to Belfast!

Additionally, we've got communal manufacturing equipment, computing facilities
and electronic resources to let you play and build to your heart's content. Typical projects and events cover a wide range of areas including:

  * Electronics, communications and computer science;
  * Manufacturing, making & craft;
  * Light metalworking & woodworking;
  * Biohacking & chemistry;
  * Local user & interest groups;
  * _**anything and everything you want to do!**_

The level of
freedom in the labs is occasionally mistaken...

 We simply provide a space and tools for people, and members are under no obligations or requirements at all. Members can come as little or as often as they like, 24 hours a day, and can use as many of the resources as they please. Farset doesn't ask for anything extra, and we don't take any stake in your wildly successful ideas. However, we ask members to adhere to a code of conduct to avoid injury, upset... and fires.

# The Space

Farset Labs has capacity for most projects, big or small. Three main rooms cover a total of 2000ft<sup>2</sup> (190m<sup>2</sup>), providing co-working, events, and project hacking space, as well as a kitchen and lounge. The building is situated on the [Weavers Court](http://www.weaverscourt.com/) business park, with ample parking, 24/7 security, and potential access to further office and warehousing space, all five mins' walk from Belfast city centre.

##Co-Working Room
  * Flexible hot-desking on a first-come-first-served basis.

##Events Room

##Project Room

The Event space has
presentation facilities, a 30sqm Blackboard, and capacity for 60 standing and
40 sitting (comfortably...)

The Event Space, Workshop, and Lounge
can be booked for private events/meetings/projects, but are generally
available on a 'fair use' basis.

Farset Labs is a welcome, free place to explore technology and it's effect on society, whether it be academic, comedic, artistic, or pedantic; It's a place where knowledge is freely shared and experience is gained not only through successes, but also in failures.

The Blackboard makes for a
dynamic brainstorming and presentation environment

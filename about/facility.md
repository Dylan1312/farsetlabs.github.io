# Facilities & Resources

[![](http://farsetlabs.org.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/IMG_1768_1-682x1024.jpg)](http://farsetlabs.org.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/IMG_1768_1.jpg) The half-life of any project is around
14 days...

# The Basics

Farset Labs is a [hackerspace ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace)that
provides a place for creativity and technological tinkering. We're open to
everyone, no matter what you want to do, and we welcome people from all walks
of life to use our space, come to our events, and get involved at a low level
to foster the maker community in Northern Ireland.

> For a low membership fee, students, hobbyists, and all members of the local
community will be able to come together, hack at projects, build stuff and
bring some life to Belfast!

Additionally, we've got communal manufacturing equipment, computing facilities
and electronic resources to let you play and build to your heart's content. We
operate over a wide range of areas including:

  * Electronics and computer science;
  * Manufacturing & making;
  * Biohacking;
  * Amateur Radio & Communications;
  * LARP (Live Action Role Play);
  * Cosplaying and gaming;
  * Local user groups;
  * Light metalworking & woodworking;
  * _**anything and everything you want to do!**_

It's possible the level of
freedom in the labs is occasionally misguided...

> We simply provide a space and tools for people, and members are under no
obligations or requirements at all. Members can come as little or as often as
they like, 24 hours a day, and can use as many of the resources as they
please. Farset doesn't ask for anything extra, and we certainly, certainly
don't take any stake in your wildly-successful ideas!

# The Space

With ~2000sqft of combined hackspace, workshop, meeting, relaxing and venue-
space, Farset Labs has capacity for most projects, big or small. (We also have
access to a 5000sqft Warehouse for experiments, subject to availability, as
well as the entire outside area of the business park, kindly offered by
[Weavers Court](http://www.weaverscourt.com/))

The Event space has
presentation facilities, a 30sqm Blackboard, and capacity for 60 standing and
40 sitting (comfortably...)

The Event Space, Workshop, and Lounge
can be booked for private events/meetings/projects, but are generally
available on a 'fair use' basis.

> Farset Labs is a welcome, free place to explore technology and it's effect
on society, whether it be academic, comedic, artistic, or pedantic; It's a
place where knowledge is freely shared and experience is gained not only
through successes, but also in failures.

The Blackboard makes for a
dynamic brainstorming and presentation environment

We got lots of new
desks recently, so the space is quite a lively place to work and
play

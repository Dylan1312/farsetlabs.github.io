The half-life of any project is around 14 days...

# The Basics

Farset Labs is a [makerspace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace) that
provides a place for creativity and technological tinkering. We're open to
everyone, no matter what you want to do, and we welcome people from all walks
of life to use our space, come to our events, and get involved at a low level
to foster the maker community in Northern Ireland.

For a low membership fee, students, hobbyists, and all members of the local community will be able to come together, hack at projects, build stuff and bring some life to Belfast!

Farset Labs provides a wide range of communal resources, so you can play and build as you wish. These include:

  * Dedicated high-speed fibre internet.
  * Ample networking and server resources.
  * Kitchen and lounge.
  * A growing library of tools, manufacturing equipment, parts and gadgets, including: 3D printer, quadcopter, various robots, and computers of all sorts such as Raspberry Pis, iMacs, BBC Micros and a hefty archive of gaming consoles.

Typical projects and events for all skill levels include:

  * Electronics, communications and computer science.
  * Manufacturing, making & craft.
  * Light metalworking & woodworking.
  * Biohacking & chemistry.
  * Local user & interest groups.
  * _**anything and everything you want to do!**_

We provide space, tools and community. Members are under no obligations or requirements at all. Members can come as little or as often as they like, 24 hours a day, and can use as many of the resources as they please. Farset doesn't ask for anything extra, and we don't take any stake in your wildly successful ideas. However, we ask members to adhere to a code of conduct to avoid injury, upset... and fires.

# The Space

Farset Labs has capacity for most projects, big or small. Three main rooms cover a total of 2000ft<sup>2</sup> (190m<sup>2</sup>), providing co-working, events, and project hacking space, as well as a kitchen and lounge. The building is situated on the [Weavers Court](http://www.weaverscourt.com/) business park, with ample parking, 24/7 security, and potential access to further office and warehousing space, all five mins' walk from Belfast city centre.

###Co-Working Room
  * Flexible hot-desking and several computers, all on first-come-first-served basis.
  * Printing, photocopying and other office faciliites.

###Events Room
  * Multipurpose venue for approx 60 standing / 40 seated. 
  * Comprehensive AV setup, including projector, 5:1 surround sound speakers, and PA system.
  * 30m<sup>2</sup> blackboard for idea sharing (surely the biggest in N.Ireland!).

###Project Room
  * Fabrication machines and hand-tools.
  * Library of tech & craft components.
  * Mobile workbenches.
  * Project storage shelving and boxes.

The Event Room, and potentially other areas, can be booked for private events/meetings/projects, but are generally
available on a 'fair use' basis.

Farset Labs is a welcome, free place to explore technology and it's effect on society, whether it be academic, comedic, artistic, or pedantic; It's a place where knowledge is freely shared and experience is gained not only through successes, but also in failures. We are witnessing the next industrial revolution as it happens and just don't want to miss out on the fun.

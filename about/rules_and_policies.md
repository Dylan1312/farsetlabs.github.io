# Dem Rules 

Any community needs a few rules to stay safe and fun, and we don't like making more than we have to. 

These can be summarised in two statements:

* Leave the space better than you found it

* Treat others (and their stuff) as you expect you (and your stuff) to be treated.

If this is somehow not clear or you believe you have found a loophole, please read on.

* [Operations Manual](ops_manual.html)
* [Child Protection Policy](child_protection.html)
* [Equality Policy](equality.html)

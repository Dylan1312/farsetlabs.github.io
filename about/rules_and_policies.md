# Dem Rules 

Any community needs a few rules to stay safe and fun, and we don't like making more than we have to. 

These can be summarised in two statements:

* Leave the space better than you found it.
* Treat others (and their stuff) as you expect you (and your stuff) to be treated.

If this is somehow not clear or you believe you have found a loophole, please read on.

## Reimbursement of Travel Costs Policy

Farset Labs will reimburse a member or appointed person for company related travel expenditures within the limits set below when appropriate approval has been given.

Approval should be obtained prior to travel otherwise expenses are incurred at the traveler’s risk. Member travel expenses require the approval of a single active Director by either written or emailed approval.

It is the responsibility of those approving and handing out reimbursements to ensure that

* Expenses are incurred for the benefit of or are in the best interests of the Charity.
* Approval has been sought within an appropriate time frame of travel.
* Expenses are reasonable within the limits set below, incurred as outlined above and reasonable effort has gone to minimise cost to the Charity.
